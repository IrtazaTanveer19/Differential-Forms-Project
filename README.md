# PHY442 Project

A Github repository containing my course project for PHY442 (General Relativity).

This project involved the study of differential forms and rewriting Maxwell's Equations using them. 

The PDF file is the final report that was submitted. 

The PPTX file is the PowerPoint presentation that was made for presenting the project to the professor.
